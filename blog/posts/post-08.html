          <p>Midterms are this week and today I am going back over the material for one class, trying to get ahead on the work for another, all so I can devote more time over the next 2 weeks to my Digital-Fundamentals class. I have to read almost 100 pages on some of the most heavy and dense material I have encountered so far covering combinational circuits, latches, and shift registers; the hardest part is avoiding glossing over the material and taking adequate notes.</p>

<p>A couple of weeks ago I had part 1 of a final for my web design class due, and like a true college student I didn't start on it until the night before it was due. Unfortunately, I also had work that day on the closing shift, so I didn't get off until 10pm. I didn't go home however; instead I set up my stuff in the break room, went out onto the sales floor to get a frozen pizza and a monster, then came back to heat it up as well as pour some coffee.

I took me until 3:30am, but I finally finished part 1 of my final as a sort of minimum viable product for the assignment.</p>

<br>
<p>I completely underestimated how long this would take. I watched all of my former night shift friends clock in and get to work, come back 2 hours later for their break, and then come back 2 hours after that to take their lunches while I sat in the corner cobbling together something that should have been done over the last 2 weeks. It was a learning experience though, having such a tight deadline (being due in about 12 hours) forced me to use and gain hands on experience with things like bootstrap and responsive design as well as further develop my working knowledge of HTML & CSS.</p>
<p>On different note, recently I have had to stop self studying C++ in order to make time for study for my Digital-Fundamentals class. I was kind of able to find a nice spot in my textbook to stop, getting as far as the basics of Inheritance and building a test program to play with it a little. If only I could stop sleeping I would have more timeâ€¦.</p>

<br>
<p>Have been making strides through free code camp, so far completing HTML & CSS, Bootstrap, and JQuery; as well as uploading each completed challenge to github.


I am doing this not only because my web design class requires a small portion of it, but because most of the developer job postings I have looked at so far require web design skills to some extent despite them not being web developer positions, so FCC seems to be very good at helping me gain those skills.</p>
