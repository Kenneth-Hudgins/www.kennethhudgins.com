            <p>On October 26th, at 8:00pm, I suddenly got a bad case of what felt like food poisening; and from then until 1:00am I was on the floor in front of my toilet throwing up everything I had consumed in the past couple of days. After that I couldnt sleep until around 4:30pm and then I woke up at 7am feeling incredibly weak wondering why I couldnt sleep longer. After dragging my self out of bed, every step reminding me my sudden weakness, something I could feel in my very bones, I went to go check on the dog since my family was away.</p>

            <p>Initially thought I thought I might have gotten food poisoning from the steak and eggs I had made the night before and shared with my little dachshund wiener dog. I fully expected him to be as sick as my decrepit self but he was as healthy as ever so I guess it was just me who got sick from god knows what, made worse by me having gone hard in the gym on leg day 6 hours or so before getting sick, coupled with less than 3 hours of sleep and I could barely find strength to move my legs. Ended up spending most of the day curled up on the couch under several blankets with the dog watching sponge bob reruns on tv, downing a powerade every other hour in an attempt to gain back some of the 4lbs+ of water & weight I lost the night before. </p>

            <p>Things got better though, that night I got 10+ hours of sleep and woke up mostly fine the next day, and got closer to being 100% every day after that.</p>

            <p>Crazy how that happens.</p>

            <p>Anyway, school is still fine. Last I checked I  had a 92 in math and as hard as it is I try to remember the semester is almost over. Job wise have been sending out application after application to entry level IT and other such jobs in Texas, so many in fact that I had a dream about working in Sears for some reason…? Mostly help-desk and “PC-Technician” stuff, and a few call center jobs too. I actually heard back from a few places, the first one let me know that I hadn't been selected but that I should change somethings on my resume, which stung but at least they helped me out by giving me feedback on my (hindsight being 20/20, obviously terrible) resume. I made the specified changes and now it looks so much better.</p>

            <p>I was actually accepted to one job, a call center position for $10.50 an hour doing troubleshooting for point of sale devices at gas stations. I showed up for the interview and they were happy to offer me the job, the only problem being that it was 2 hours away, in the middle of nowhere, rent for even the shadiest of apartments was fairly high not including utilities, local internet sucked, and the only gym for miles had closed the month previous. I felt bad because I all but signed for the job, but after driving 2 hours back home and sleeping on it I woke up the next day knowing it would be a bad move. Called them the next morning and said I was no longer interested in the position. I felt like a dick because they were so nice and I pretty much wasted their time, but in the grand scheme of things I need to take care of my self because no one else will.</p>

            <p>A few hours later on the same day I did an over the phone interview for a help desk position at some sort of health services place, and I think that went great,  but after looking it up its almost 3 hours away on the other side of dallas. At this point the only way for me to afford to take any of these jobs is if they pay $12+ an hour or I find a room-mate. What ever I do, I need to hurry up because when the semester ends the computer lab I work in closes for almost a month and I don't have enough savings to last much longer than that.</p>

            <p>I ended up selling my main computer on eBay for $750, which when you consider that I bought it for $850, $100 for a year rental wasn't that bad. I opted to replace it with  a “Command Center”, as one of my ex military friends called it. A “Lenovo ThinkPad P72 Mobile Workstation” with a 6 core i7, 32GB of RAM, and an Nvidia P3200 graphics card. It was hellla expensive but I got it over 20% off with a coupon including a 3 year warranty at a 2 year price. My only qualm is that it wont get here until December 3rd. With this new machine I will be able too experiment with everything I am currently unable to due lack of hardware like database usage/management, networking including virtual networked computers with active directory, and anything else I could need to further my knowledge in the industry; all without being confined to a single geographically placed desktop.</p>
